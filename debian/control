Description: improved nagios compatible monitoring engine
 Centreon Engine offers a mature alternative to Nagios. Centreon Engine is a
 monitoring engine more powerful than Nagios. More advandes in terms of
 functionality and more resource-efficient, it can better integrate into
 existing systems (cloud, virtualization, light boxes).
 .
 Centreon development teams gave life to Centreon Engine using version 3.2.3
 Nagios as a starting point. Their goal is to improve performance and
 motivate the community with new challenges.
 .
 Today, all external stakeholders are invited to join us to work with our
 team on larger improvements. For 2 years, we have made sure to meet user
 demands for technical improvements (performance enhancements, connectors,
 building code sources, unit testing) and functional (simplified
 configuration, polling for the second, recurring downtimes , timezones
 management, correlation, ...).
